      #
      # Because we have not yet run the install phase (we're running these tests
      # as part of `checkPhase` instead of `installCheckPhase`) these absolute
      # paths do not exist yet; to work around this we point the loader (`ld` on
      # unix, `dyld` on macOS) at the `lib` directory which will later become this
      # package's `lib` output.
      #
      # Previously we would just set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the build `lib`
      # dir but:
      #   - this doesn't generalize well to other platforms; `lit` doesn't forward

      #   - even if `lit` forwarded this env var, we actually cannot set
      #     `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the child processes `lit` launches because
      #     `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (and `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`) is cleared for
      #     "protected processes" (i.e. the python interpreter that runs `lit`):

        The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
        toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
        traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it
        is the full name of the project.
        LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the
        goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of
        supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming
        languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting
        of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by
        a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being
        widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed
        under the "Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions".
